How do you treat type 2 diabetes?,"When you have type 2 diabetes, you first need to eat a healthy diet, stay physically active and lose any extra weight. If these lifestyle changes cannot control your blood sugar, you also may need to take pills and other injected medication, including insulin."
How do you treat type 2 diabetes?,"Eating a healthy diet, being physically active, and losing any extra weight is the first line of therapy. Diet and exercise are the foundation of all diabetes management because it makes your body cells respond better to insulin (in other words, it decreases insulin resistance) and lowers blood sugar levels."
How do you treat type 2 diabetes?,"If you cannot normalize or control the blood sugars with diet, weight loss, and exercise, the next treatment phase is taking medicine either orally or by injection.
Diabetes pills work in different ways some lower insulin resistance, others slow the digestion of food or increase insulin levels in the blood stream. The non-insulin injected medications for type 2 diabetes have a complicated action but basically lower blood glucose after eating. Insulin therapy simply increases insulin in the circulation."
How do you treat type 2 diabetes?,"Dont be surprised if you have to use multiple medications to control the blood sugar. Multiple medications, also known as combination therapy is common in the treatment of diabetes! If one medication is not enough, you medical provider may give you two or three or more different types of pills. Insulin or other injected medications also may be prescribed. Or, depending on your medical condition, you may be treated only with insulin or injected medication therapy.

Many people with type 2 diabetes have elevated blood fats (high triglycerides and cholesterol) and blood pressure, so you may be given medications for these problems as well."
"Can type 2 diabetes go away? And if my blood sugar becomes normal, do I still have diabetes?","Type 2 diabetes is a genetic condition or pre-disposition that doesnt change with treatment. However diabetes is defined as an elevated blood sugar.
When your blood sugar is normal with no treatment, then the diabetes is considered to have gone away. However, even when the blood sugars are controlled, because type 2 diabetes is a genetic condition, the predisposition for diabetes always exists. High blood sugars can come back.

If you have type 2 diabetes and the blood sugar is controlled during treatment (diet, exercise and medications), it means that the treatment plan is working. You are getting the good blood sugar because of the treatment NOT because diabetes predisposition has gone away. You will need to continue your treatment; otherwise your blood sugar will go back up."
Will I need to take insulin if I have type 2 diabetes?,"Maybe. Historically, 30% or more of people with type 2 diabetes required insulin therapy. However there are many new drugs available that may delay or prevent the need for insulin therapy. It is expected that fewer and fewer individuals will need insulin replacement to control their blood sugars."
"As someone with type 2 diabetes, do I turn into a type 1 diabetic when I take insulin?","No. Taking insulin does not mean that you have type 1 diabetes. Your type of diabetes is determined by your genetics, not by the type of therapy."
"If I have type 2 diabetes and take insulin, do I have to take it forever?","Not necessarily. If you can lose weight, change your diet, increase your activity level, or change your medications you may be able to reduce or stop insulin therapy. Under certain circumstances, you may only need insulin temporarily such as during pregnancy, acute illness, after surgery or when treated with drugs that increase their body's resistance to the action of insulin (such as prednisone or steroids). Often the insulin therapy can be stopped after the event or stress is over."
Will exercise help my diabetes?,"Exercise is very beneficial in the management of type 2 diabetes. Always consult with your doctor about exercise guidelines, to exercise safely and reduce risks."
If I have type 2 diabetes can I stop taking diabetes medications if I eliminate candy and cookies from my diet?,"If you eliminate concentrated sources of carbohydrates (foods that turn into sugar in your blood stream) like candy and cookies, you may be able to reduce or eliminate the need for diabetes medications. Everyone with type 2 diabetes will benefit from an improved diet, but you may still need other interventions, such as increased physical activity, weight loss or medications to keep your blood sugars in the target range. Check with your doctor about any diabetes medication dose adjustments that may be required if you change your diet."
Do I need to monitor my blood sugar when I have type 2 diabetes?,"You may feel fine, but that is no guarantee that your blood sugar levels are in the target range. Remember, diabetic complications do not appear right away. And complications may develop even when the blood sugar is only slightly elevated. Regular blood sugar monitoring can help you keep your blood sugars in control and prevent serious damage to your eyes, kidneys and nerves. If your sugar levels are out of line, consult your doctor."
Are my children at risk?,"Yes. Type 2 diabetes is a genetic disease. The risk is highest when multiple family members have diabetes, and if the children also are overweight, sedentary and have the other risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Your child has a 10-15% chance of developing type 2 diabetes when you have type 2 diabetes. And if one identical twin has type 2 diabetes, there is a 75% likelihood of the other twin developing type 2 diabetes also."
Can type 2 diabetes be prevented?,"Although we cannot change your genetic risk for developing type 2 diabetes, we do know that even modest exercise and weight loss can delay or prevent the development of type 2 diabetes. A landmark research study in the United States, the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) was completed in 2002 and showed that when people modified their risk factors for type 2 diabetes, they reduced their chance of developing the condition. Similar results have been shown in Finland."
What is diabetes?,"Diabetes is a disease in which blood glucose (sugar) levels are above normal. Plant foods which are mostly sugars and starches (carbohydrates) are turned into glucose, or sugar, for our bodies to use for energy. The pancreas, an organ that lies near the stomach, makes a hormone called insulin to help glucose get into the cells of our bodies. When you have diabetes, your body either does not make enough insulin or cannot use its own insulin as well as it should. This causes sugar to build up in your blood. Diabetes can cause serious health complications including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower-extremity amputations. Diabetes is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States."
What are symptoms of diabetes?,"Individuals who think they might have diabetes should visit a physician for diagnosis. They might have SOME or NONE of the following symptoms:
Frequent urination, Excessive thirst, Unexplained weight loss, Extreme hunger, Sudden vision changes, Tingling or numbness in hands or feet, Feeling very tired much of the time, Very dry skin
Sores that are slow to heal
More infections than usual"
What is the treatment for diabetes,"People with diabetes must take responsibility for their day-to-day care, and keep blood glucose levels from going too low or too high. People with diabetes should see a health care provider who will monitor their diabetes control and help them learn to manage their diabetes. A diabetes health care team is also recommended. The patient and primary care provider are leaders of the team. Other members of the team might include endocrinologists, who may specialize in diabetes care; ophthalmologists for eye examinations; podiatrists for routine foot care; and dietitians and diabetes educators who teach the skills needed for daily diabetes management."
What is prediabetes?,"A person with prediabetes has a blood sugar level higher than normal, but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. He or she is at higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes and other serious health problems, including heart disease, and stroke. Without lifestyle changes to improve their health, 15% to 30% of people with prediabetes will develop type 2 diabetes within five years.

A person with certain risk factors is more likely to develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. These risk factors include: age, especially after 45 years of age; being overweight or obese; a family history of diabetes; having an African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Asian American, or Pacific Islander racial or ethnic background; a history of diabetes while pregnant (gestational diabetes) or having given birth to a baby weighing nine pounds or more; and being physically active less than three times a week."
What should my blood sugar be?,The American Diabetes Association recommends a blood glucose range of 80-130 before meals and less than 180 about 2 hours after a meal. This range should place your A1c under 7.
What is an A1c?,A Hemoglobin A1c is a 2-3 month average of your blood sugars. This result gives you a good idea of how well your diabetes is being managed/controlled. The American Diabetes Association recommends an A1c of less than 7 to keep the risk of complications low.
What can I eat if I have diabetes?,You can eat just about anything you want. It is about knowing proper portion sizes and how much you are putting on your plate. A dietitian can help you learn to count carbohydrates and with meal planning that is specific for you.
Why does it matter if my blood sugar is 120 or 200?,"It is very important to keep your blood sugar level under control. When your blood sugar level is high, it can cause damage in your veins and arteries. This damage could lead to complications later such as heart attacks, strokes, kidney disease, neuropathies, vision problems, etc. "
What foods have carbohydrates?,"Fruits, starchy vegetables, milk, yogurt, rice, cereals, bread and other grains all have carbs and give you important nutrients. Many snack foods, such as pretzels, chips and popcorn, have carbs. Sweets, including regular soda, cakes, candy and cookies, also contain carbohydrates. Be sure to check the nutrition label on each food item to determine carbohyrdate content."
Do I need to follow a low carb diet?,"Carbohydrates are an important part of a healthy diet. With diabetes, watching portion sizes and getting most of your carbs from fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low fat milk and yogurt is key. Besides counting carbs, people with diabetes can also benefit from eating lower fat, high fiber foods and just enough calories to maintain a healthy weight."
"If it is sugar free, I can eat as much as I want, right?","Sugar free foods can be part of a healthy meal plan in small amounts. Keep in mind though that some of these foods still have carbs (in the form of other sweeteners such as sorbitol, isomalt, and mannitol) and may affect your blood glucose levels. Many sugar free foods have calories and carbohydrates and lots of fat. Make sure you read the nutrition labels."
What resources are available to help me control my diabetes?  ,Diabetes classes are offered by Maury Regional Health and can be scheduled by your provider at with a certified diabetes educator and/or dietitian. This class is recognized by the American Diabetes Association.
What are the types of diabetes?,"Type 1 diabetes
Type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5% of all diagnosed cases of diabetes. Type 1 is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, although it can occur at any time. People with type 1 diabetes must use insulin from an injection or a pump to manage their diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes accounts for about 95% of all cases diagnosed in adults. Several studies have shown that healthy eating, regular physical activity, and weight loss used with medication if prescribed, can help control complications from type 2 diabetes or can prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.
Gestational diabetes
Gestational diabetes is diagnosed in 2 to 10% of pregnant women. Gestational diabetes can cause health problems during pregnancy for both the child and mother. Children whose mothers had gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes. Although gestational diabetes often goes away after pregnancy, about half of all women who have gestational diabetes get type 2 diabetes later in life."
What are the symptoms of diabetes?,"Being very thirsty
Urinating often
Feeling very hungry
Feeling very tired
Losing weight without trying
Sores that heal slowly
Dry, itchy skin
Feelings of pins and needles in your feet
Losing feeling in your feet
Blurry eyesight
Some people with diabetes dont have any of these signs or symptoms. The only way to know if you have diabetes is to have your doctor do a blood test."
How is diabetes diagnosed?,"Urine analysis
A urine analysis may show high blood sugar. But a urine test alone does not diagnose diabetes. Your health care provider may suspect that you have diabetes if your blood sugar level is higher than 200 mg/dL. To confirm the diagnosis, one or more of the following tests must be done.

Blood tests
Fasting blood glucose test, hemoglobin A1c test, and oral glucose tolerance test are blood test that can be done to diagnose diabetes.

Screening
Screening for type 2 diabetes in people who have no symptoms is recommended for: overweight children who have other risk factors for diabetes (starting at age 10), overweight adults (BMI greater than 25) who have other risk factors, and adults over age 45."
What risk factors increase the likelihood of diabetes?,"Being overweight or obese
Having a parent, brother, or sister with diabetes
Being African American, American Indian, Asian American, Pacific Islander, or Hispanic American/Latino heritage
Having a prior history of gestational diabetes or the birth of at least one baby weighing more than 9 pounds
Having high blood pressure measuring 140/90 or higher
Having abnormal cholesterol with HDL (""good"") cholesterol is 35 or lower, or triglyceride level is 250 or higher
Being physically exercising fewer than three times a week"
What can be done to reduce the risk of diabetes?,"Research has shown that the following lifestyle modifications can prevent, or at least delay the onset of type 2 diabetes among people at risk of diabetes:
Eating fewer high fat and high calorie foods
Losing at least 5%-7% of body weight (if overweight)
Being physically active for 150 minutes every week"
Can I still travel if I have diabetes?,Of course. People with diabetes travel all over the world you do not need to choose special holidays or curb your wander lust. The key is making the right preparations to minimize any potential problems and have an enjoyable safe trip.
Do I need to take insulin for the rest of my life?,"Yes. People with type 1 diabetes are not making enough insulin from their own bodies. Most people inject insulin at least four times a day. However, the insulin pump, or a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), is slowly replacing frequent injections as a preferred delivery system. With the pump, a new catheter is inserted every few days under the skin, and insulin is continuously infused into the body. The pump is not the final word in insulin delivery systems, and there are clinical trials underway testing both a patch and a nasal spray as possible insulin delivery systems"
Will exercise help control my diabetes?,"In general, exercise can be beneficial in the management of type 1 diabetes, in addition to taking insulin and eating a healthy diet. To exercise safely and reduce the risks, always consult with your doctor about exercise guidelines."
Can I stop taking insulin if I eliminate candy and cookies from my diet?,"Even if you eliminate concentrated sources of carbohydrates (foods that turn into sugar in your bloodstream) like candy and cookies, you always need to take insulin when you have type 1 diabetes. Check with your doctor about any insulin dose adjustments that may be required if you change your diet."
Do I need to monitor my blood sugar even when I�m feeling fine?,"Feeling fine is no guarantee that your blood sugar levels are in the target range. Remember, symptoms do not appear right away. Without regular blood sugar monitoring, serious damage can happen to your eyes, kidneys, feet even your brain without your knowing. If your sugar levels are out of line, consult your doctor."
I have type 1 diabetes. Are my children at risk?,"Yes, but the risk is low. Although type 1 diabetes is a genetic disease, only about 3% to 6% of children of type 1 diabetics will develop diabetes. The risk varies with age, gender, and other factors relating to the parent with diabetes. You can learn more about these odds by having your children undergo certain genetic tests."
